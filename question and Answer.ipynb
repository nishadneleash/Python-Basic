    "1. What is Python, and why is it popular \n",
    "ans: python is high level, general purpos progrmming.\n",
    "*ssimple and readable\n",
    "*easy to learn data structure.\n",
    "it is popular because\n",
    "beginer friendly, vesatile, huge community and large library support and cross platform.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. What is an interpreter in Python \n",
    "ans: An interpreter translate python progrma written by programmer into machine language line by line and executes the code.\n",
    "no need to compile the prgrame in python.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3.What are pre-defined keywords in Python \n",
    "ans: pre-defined keyword are reserved keywords in python which cannot be used as variables, identifiers, function names in python.\n",
    "\n",
    "example: false , true, for , while , break , try \n",
    "\n",
    "4.Can keywords be used as variable names \n",
    "ans: no we cannot use the variable names as keyword in python. it will give an syntax error.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.What is mutability in Python \n",
    "ans: mutability refers that wheather or not an object can be changed after its created.\n",
    "\n",
    "mutable: can be changed ex: list,dict\n",
    "immutable: cannot be changed ex: str, tuple\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable \n",
    "ans: list are mutable beacuse : python allow us to change once list is created. list are flexiable and can be changed after creation.\n",
    "     tuple are immutable because: In python there aare some sensitive data that cannot be changed after creation. because we need fixed and reliable data. it improves safety and performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "7.What is the difference between “==” and “is” operators in Python \n",
    "ans: \"==\" means equality example a==b\n",
    "     \"is\" means memory location in python it can be same bur with different location.\n",
    "      Ex: a=(1,2,3) and b =(1,2,3) same but diffrent memory location\n",
    "\n",
    "8.What are logical operators in Python \n",
    "ans: logical operator in python are used to cobine or compare multiple conditionss for decision making.\n",
    "logical and , logical or , logical and\n",
    "\n",
    "9. What is type casting in Python \n",
    "type casting in python means converting one data type to another like str to int and float.\n",
    "\n",
    "10.What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting \n",
    "ans: python automatically converts data type is inplicit type casting.\n",
    "     in python if we manually convert data type than its explicit typecasting . we control the data type.\n",
    "\n",
    "11.What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python \n",
    "Conditional statements in Python are used to make decisions in your program.\n",
    "They allow your code to perform different actions based on whether a condition is True or False.\n",
    "ex: if elif else\n",
    "it contraol the execution flow depending on contions given.\n",
    "\n",
    "12.How does the elif statement work \n",
    "Python checks the first if condition.\n",
    "If True, it runs that block and skips the rest.\n",
    "If False, it checks the elif conditions in order.\n",
    "If none of them are true, it runs the else block.\n",
    "\n",
    "syntax: \n",
    "if condition1:\n",
    "    # Runs if condition1 is True\n",
    "elif condition2:\n",
    "    # Runs if condition1 is False AND condition2 is True\n",
    "elif condition3:\n",
    "    # Runs if all above are False and condition3 is True\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    # Runs if none of the above conditions are True\n",
    "\n",
    "13.What is the difference between for and while loops \n",
    "For Loop:\n",
    "Use case : When you know how many times to loop\t\n",
    "Structure: Loops over a sequence ex: range\n",
    "Example:    for i in range(5):\n",
    "Stops when: Sequence is finished\t\n",
    "\n",
    "while Loop:\n",
    " Use case : When you don’t know how many times\n",
    "  Structure:   Loops as long as a condition is True\n",
    " Example:    while i < 5:\n",
    "Stops when:     while i < 5:\n",
    "\n",
    "14.Describe a scenario where a while loop is more suitable than a for loop.\n",
    "A while loop is better when you don’t know in advance how many times you'll need to repeat something.\n",
